# capstone-clothing-store

In this capstone project I made a website that sells high-end clothing. The concept for this website was to look more old school like, similar to old myspace designs back in the day.

A cool piece of code that I would like to showcase is either my login as it references to the registration page if the user needs to make an account for the website.
